# Agriculture Project: Smart Billing and Field Monitoring System

## **Overview**
This project aims to provide an integrated solution for online billing of agricultural costs and real-time monitoring of field conditions. The software offers an intuitive user interface to check the status of each field, including:

- **Humidity levels**
- **Availability of necessary ingredients (e.g., fertilizers, water, etc.)**
- **Field status updates**

Additionally, the software connects remotely to hardware devices, enabling seamless data collection from the fields.

   - Track and bill agricultural costs (e.g., water usage, fertilizers, and other resources).
   - Generate detailed invoices for field operations.

2. **Field Monitoring**:
   - Display real-time field conditions, including humidity and ingredient levels.
   - Provide notifications or alerts when specific conditions require attention.

3. **Hardware Integration**:
   - Connect to IoT-enabled hardware for automated data collection.
   - Support for remote connectivity to minimize on-site intervention.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - An intuitive frontend built with React for monitoring and managing data.
   - Responsive design for seamless use on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
